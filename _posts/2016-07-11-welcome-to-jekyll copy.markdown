Jekyll is a super awesome static site generator. Here is how I made my site using it!


------------------------------------------
First thing you want to do is 

#1. install jekyll... 
More details to come...

------------------------------------------

------------------------------------------

#2. jekyll build 

 - open up terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want your repository to exist locally. *I recommend the home directory!*

to be continued.....
 
--------------------------------------------------------
 
#3. Deploy site to github pages!
